# Cyber.AI
This project aims to build an intelligent system that fetches newly published vulnerabilities from a live CVE database (such as NVD or Vulners), uses AI to analyze them, and automatically tests client software for related weak points.  It combines cybersecurity, software testing, and AI to automate vulnerability detection and threat assessment.
